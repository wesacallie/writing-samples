    <H1>Adding Other Assets as Data Sources</H1>
    <H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>Telemetry collection has been extended to devices not managed by the Cisco DNA Center, enabling customers to view and interact with telemetry-derived insights and analytics for a broader range of devices. After the initial CX Cloud Agent setup, users have the option to configure CX Cloud Agent to connect to 20 additional Cisco DNA Centers within the infrastructure monitored by CX Cloud. Users can also connect CX Cloud Agent directly to other hardware assets in their environment, up to 10,000 directly connected devices.</p>
    <p>Users can identify devices to incorporate into CX Cloud by uniquely identifying such devices using a seed file or by specifying an IP range, which should be scanned by CX Cloud Agent. Both approaches rely on Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for the purpose of discovery (SNMP) and on Secure Shell (SSH) for connectivity. These must be properly configured to enable successful telemetry collection.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Either the seed file or IP range can be used. It is not possible to change this selection after the initial set-up.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> An initial seed file can be replaced with another seed file while an initial IP range can be edited to a new IP range.</p>
    <p>When <b>Other Assets</b> is selected from the data sources connection window, the following window opens:</p>
