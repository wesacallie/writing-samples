           <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I bring over 12 years of technical writing experience to the table, and what truly drives me is translating complex technical concepts into clear, accessible content for diverse audiences. Working in global teams has been an enriching experience, and I thrive on learning new tools and technologies to enhance productivity. Building strong relationships is key for meâ€”I value not just my immediate team members but also those I collaborate with across different teams.
            </p>
            <p>One of my key strengths is my ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams, including software engineers, product managers, and UX designers. I have a proven track record of managing the agile documentation lifecycle using tools such as Jira, Kanban boards, and team dashboards, ensuring efficient tracking of features, stories, tasks, and defects.
            </p>
            <p>I am passionate about staying at the forefront of industry trends and emerging technologies, continually enhancing my skills to deliver impactful content that resonates with target audiences. My commitment to excellence, coupled with my ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics, positions me as a valuable asset in any content-focused role.</p>
            <h1>Documentation Samples</h1>
            <p>I created this site as a way to provide writing samples, as most of my work has been "Company Confidential". I did find some public documentation that I've written that I've can use as samples. I created documentation in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>. I've provided links below to this documentation as well as my GitHub site.</p>
