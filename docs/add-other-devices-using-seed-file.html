            <h2>Add Devices Using a New Seed File</h2>
            <h3>About the Seed File</h3>
            <p>A seed file is a comma-separated values (csv) file where each line represents a system data record. In a seed file, every seed file record corresponds to a unique device from which telemetry should be collected by CX Cloud Agent. All error or information messages for each device entry from the seed file being imported are captured as part of job log details. All devices in a seed file are considered managed devices, even if the devices are unreachable at the time of initial configuration. In the event a new seed file is being uploaded to replace a previous one, the date of last upload is displayed in CX Cloud.</p>
            <p>CX Cloud Agent will attempt to connect to the devices but may not be able to process each one to show in the Assets pages in cases where it is not able to determine the PIDs or Serial Numbers. Any row in the seed file that starts with a semicolon is ignored. The header row in the seed file starts with a semicolon and can be kept as is (recommended option) or deleted while creating the customer seed file.</p>
            <p>It is important that the format of the sample seed file, including column headers, not be altered in any way. The seed file is provided in PDF format.</p>

            <div class="info">
                <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This PDF is for reference only and can be used to create a seed file that needs to be saved in .csv format.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The following table identifies all necessary seed file columns and the data that must be included in each column.</p>

            <h2>Telemetry Processing Limitations for Devices</h2>
            <p>The following are limitations when processing telemetry data for devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some devices may show as reachable in the <strong>Collection Summary</strong> but are not visible in the CX Cloud <strong>Assets</strong> page. Device instrumentation limitations prevent the processing of such device telemetry.</li>
                <li>Telemetry attributes may be inaccurate or missing in the CX Cloud <strong>Assets</strong> page for devices that are not part of the Campus Success Track.</li>
                <li>If a device from the seed file or IP range collections is also part of the Cisco DNA Center inventory, the device is reported only once for the Cisco DNA Center entry. The seed file/ IP range entry is not collected or processed to avoid duplication.</li>
