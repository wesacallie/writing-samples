            <h2>How to Add Devices Using a Seed File</h2>
            <p>To add devices using a new seed file:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the seed file template (PDF) using the embedded link in this document (refer to <strong>About the Seed File</strong>) or through a link in the <strong>Configure Connection to CX Cloud</strong> window.$nbsp;
                <div class="info">
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The link in the <strong>Configure Connection to CX Cloud</strong> window is no longer available once the initial seed file has been downloaded.</p>
                </div></li>
            </ol>
            <p>CX Cloud Agent will attempt to connect to the devices but may not be able to process each one to show in the Assets pages in cases where it is not able to determine the PIDs or Serial Numbers. Any row in the seed file that starts with a semicolon is ignored. The header row in the seed file starts with a semicolon and can be kept as is (recommended option) or deleted while creating the customer seed file.</p>
            <p>It is important that the format of the sample seed file, including column headers, not be altered in any way. The seed file is provided in PDF format.</p>

            <h2>Telemetry Processing Limitations for Devices</h2>
            <p>The following are limitations when processing telemetry data for devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some devices may show as reachable in the <strong>Collection Summary</strong> but are not visible in the CX Cloud <strong>Assets</strong> page. Device instrumentation limitations prevent the processing of such device telemetry.</li>
                <li>Telemetry attributes may be inaccurate or missing in the CX Cloud <strong>Assets</strong> page for devices that are not part of the Campus Success Track.</li>
                <li>If a device from the seed file or IP range collections is also part of the Cisco DNA Center inventory, the device is reported only once for the Cisco DNA Center entry. The seed file/ IP range entry is not collected or processed to avoid duplication.</li>
            </ul>
