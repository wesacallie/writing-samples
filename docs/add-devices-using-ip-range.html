            <h2>Add Devices Using IP Range</h2>
            <p>IP ranges allow users to identify hardware assets and, subsequently, collect telemetry from those devices based on IP addresses. The devices for telemetry collection can be uniquely identified by specifying a single network-level IP range, which should be scanned by CX Cloud Agent using the SNMP protocol. If the IP range is chosen to identify a directly connected device, the IP addresses that are referenced should be as restrictive as possible, while allowing coverage for all required assets.</p>

                <li>Specific IPs can be provided, or wildcards can be used to replace octets of an IP to create a range</li>
                <li>If a specific IP address is not included in the IP range identified during setup, CX Cloud Agent does not attempt to communicate with a device that has such an IP address, nor does it collect telemetry from such a device</li>
                <li>Entering *.*.*.* allows CX Cloud Agent to use the user-supplied credential with any IP. For example: 172.16.*.* allows the credentials to be used for all devices in the 172.16.0.0/16 subnet</li>
                <li>If there are any changes to the network or Installed Base (IB), the IP range can be modified</li>
            </ul>
            <p>CX Cloud Agent will attempt to connect to the devices but may not be able to process each one to show in the <strong>Assets</strong> view in cases where it is not able to determine the PIDs or Serial Numbers.</p>
