# Creating a Workflow

## Creating one or Multiple Workflows for an Entity

You can create a single workflow for an internal entity that has previously been created or you can create multiple workflows for that entity.

1. Select the **Workflows** tab on the SAS Visual Investigator administration interface and make sure the **Workflow Templates** tab is selected.
2. Click ![Workflow template image](/images/new-workflow-template.png). Select an object from the list. An object is disabled if a workflow has already been created for that object. The New workflow template window appears.
