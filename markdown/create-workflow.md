# Creating a Workflow

## Creating one or Multiple Workflows for an Entity

You can create a single workflow for an internal entity that has previously been created or you can create multiple workflows for that entity.

1. Select the **Workflows** tab on the SAS Visual Investigator administration interface and make sure the **Workflow Templates** tab is selected.
2. Click ![ ](images/new-workflow-template.png). Select an object from the list. An object is disabled if a workflow has already been created for that object. The New workflow template window appears.
3. In the New workflow template window, the **Label** field contains a default display name for the workflow. You can keep this name or change it. You can also enter a description for the workflow. Click **OK**.
4. In the workflow editor, select an element and drag and drop it into the workflow workspace. The Start element is already provided in the editor. Continue to drag and drop elements until you have the desired workflow.

You can also right-click an element already in the workspace to display an element menu ![ ](images/elements.png). The displayed menu is based on the element on which you right-click. Click any element on the menu to add it to the workspace.
